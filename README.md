Later versions may show an alert, if a wished item was looted.

Items are added by entering the item name or part of the item name into the input field in the left right corner, e.g. "Gruftm". You can use the item name in your WoW® language. It is recommendend, to click the "Scan" once, WoW® was started. This loads all items starting with  id 40000 in an array. That allows to search for items, which have not yet seen by th char.

If an item was not found, the entered item name is written into the textbox with a leading "nf " text.

This little addon is still under devlopement, therefore, there is no zip file for download. But if it is cloned into `/Interface/Addons` directory, it can be used.
